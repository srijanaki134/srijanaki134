<h1><b>Cab Booking System</b></h1>
<section>
A <font color="Blue">taxi</font>, also known as a <b>taxi cab</b> or simply a cab, is a type of vehicle for hire with a driver, used by a single passenger or small group of passengers, often for a non-shared ride. A taxicab conveys passengers between locations of their choice. This differs from public transport where the <font color="blue">pick-up and drop-off</font> locations are decided by the service provider, not by the <b>customers</b>, although demand responsive transport and share taxis provide a hybrid bus/taxi mode.
<ol>
<font color="blue">There are four distinct forms of taxicab, which can be identified by slightly differing terms in different countries:</font>
<ul>
<li>Hackney carriages, also known as public hire, hailed or street taxis, licensed for hailing throughout communities.</li>
<li>Private hire vehicles, also known as minicabs or private hire taxis, licensed for pre-booking only</li>
<li>Taxibuses, also come in many variations throughout the developing countries as jitneys or jeepney, operating on pre-set routes typified by multiple stops and multiple independent passengers</li>
<li>Limousines, specialized vehicle licensed for operation by pre-booking.</li>
</ul>
